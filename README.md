# hello-world

Hi there. Roshni P, a new face to GitHub and mainstream programming. Previously worked with Insurance in-house software, and now looking to branch out and learn other languages, starting with Python. Open to testing and developing. Also, I have a very sweet sweet-tooth.
Just another repository
